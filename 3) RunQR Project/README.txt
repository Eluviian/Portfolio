This folder contains a project folder for an app that mimics Pokemon Go, where you search for QR Codes instead of Pokemon.
This was a group project and I mainly worked on everything to do with PlayerStats and Leaderboard and related classes.
I also did some work on MainActivity, QRLibrary, and Player.

This folder also contains a video which show the functionality of the app in the event that in the future the database or map functionality stop working
