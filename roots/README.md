Roots Game

This project was made during Global Game Jam 2023. The official name of the game is "Down to Earth".

I was the primary Lead Designer - I came up with all mechanics, designed all levels, and signed off on all creative decisions.

I also was involved in programming - mainly level design in Unity and programming the movement of the roots through the grid system in C#.

Below is a link to the complete game, which can be played in a short time:
